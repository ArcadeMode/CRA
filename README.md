# Common Runtime for Applications

Common Runtime for Applications (CRA) is a software layer (library) that makes it easy to create and deploy distributed dataflow-style applications on top of resource managers such as Kubernetes, YARN, and stand-alone cluster execution. Currently we support stand-alone execution as well as execution in a Kubernetes/Docker environment. We will soon add instructions on how to deploy CRA to a Kubernetes cluster. 

After you clone the source code, check out the wiki at https://github.com/Microsoft/CRA/wiki for instruction on building CRA and running your first sample distributed application.
